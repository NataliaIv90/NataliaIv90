## ðŸ’¬ Summary 

I'm Natalia, a coding newbie with big dreams and small syntax errors. I'm here to turn 'I have no idea what I'm doing' into 'I got this!'.

My journey into the world of web development started with a thirst for knowledge and a laptop. I didn't have a formal education in this field, but I was determined to learn, and I believe that passion is the most important ingredient in success.

I honed my skills by devouring YouTube tutorials, scouring through resources like developer.mozilla.org, React, TypeScript and Redux documentation... This self-guided approach allowed me to grasp the intricacies of frontend development at my own pace.

Additionally, I had the privilege of attending the TechFabrique Frontend School, where I had the opportunity to learn from industry experts and collaborate with like-minded individuals. This experience not only added to my knowledge but also reinforced the importance of teamwork and effective communication in the development process.

I believe that the world of web development is a canvas where innovation and creativity can thrive, and I'm excited to be a part of this ever-evolving journey.
