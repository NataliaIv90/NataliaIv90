## 💬 Summary 

> I'm Natalia, a coding newbie with big dreams and small syntax errors. I'm here to turn "I have no idea what I'm doing" into "I got this!".
>
> I honed my skills by devouring YouTube tutorials, scouring through resources like developer.mozilla.org, React, TypeScript and Redux documentation... Additionally, I had the privilege of attending the **TechFabrique Frontend School**, where I had the opportunity to learn from industry experts and collaborate with like-minded individuals. This experience not only added to my knowledge but also reinforced the importance of teamwork and effective communication in the development process.
>
> I believe that the world of web development is a canvas where innovation and creativity can thrive, and I'm excited to be a part of this ever-evolving journey.
